### Here you can find my labs from CS 360 Programming Languages.
> As the name implies, this class's focus was to teach us multiple 
different languages in different categories. More importantly, it taught us
how to learn new languages easily on our own in a matter of a week or two. 
Each lab in this folder is labeled according to the language in which it is 
written.
