## Hello, and welcome to my Project Portfolio!
> My name is Walker Mitchell, and in this repository you will find the source code for projects that I've made. 
Many of these projects are assignments and labs from classes I've taken at Western Oregon University. In such cases 
I will include a description of the assignment for ease of understanding. I hope you have a wonderful day!

> The only noteworthy project that I am not directly including in this repository is my Senior Capstone project, 
which can be found [here.](https://gameandhang.azurewebsites.net/) If you prefer, we have recorded a video demo which you can find [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq04GrDMjn0) Please understand that it is a work
in progress until June 2020 at the earliest.
