### Here you can find my labs from CS 361 Algorithms.
> This class's focus was to teach us various aspects of dealing
 with algorithms, from calculating their complexity, to tracing 
 them iteration by iteration, etc. The labs for this class had a
 particular focus on having us implement various algorithms we 
 learned about in class, then comparing and contrasting their 
 performance.
