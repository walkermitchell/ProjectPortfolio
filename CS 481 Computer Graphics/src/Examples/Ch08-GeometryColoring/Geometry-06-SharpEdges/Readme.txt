This demo shows two similar strips of squares, one duplicating vertices to
allow for sharp quad edges, the other sharing vertices to create a smooth
appearance.

The key commands are:

i, k - translate in x
j, l - translate in y
u, o - rotate around z axis
p, ; - uniformly scale
Space - reset transforms
