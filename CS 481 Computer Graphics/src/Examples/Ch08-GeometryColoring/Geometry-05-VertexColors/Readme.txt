This demo shows the basics of vertex and index buffer-based rendering via a
custom shader, one that assigns per-vertex colors, and thus also shows how to
declare and use custom varying values between vertex and fragment shaders.

The key commands are:

i, k - translate in x
j, l - translate in y
u, o - rotate around z axis
p, ; - uniformly scale
Space - reset transforms
