This example demonstrates the frictional response between objects. Without friction, the 
objects won't spin on collision. With friction, they do get some angular velocity after
collision, even if there is no initial angular velocity.

Controls
--------
ESC: quit
I,J,K,L: generate forces in the XY direction to push the Player object around.
U,O: generate torque around Z (will also 'curl' the 'stone')
F: toggle friction
C: toggle collision response
SPACE:   resets demo
